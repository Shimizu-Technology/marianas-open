# Questions for Steve — Meeting Prep

## About the Organization

1. **What's the relationship with ASJJF?** Are you contractually required to use their registration platform, or is it by choice? Could you run your own registration alongside or instead of ASJJF?

2. **Who manages the tech currently?** Do you have anyone handling the website, social media, email? Or is it all Steve?

3. **What's the biggest operational pain point right now?** What takes the most time or causes the most headaches in running these events?

4. **How do you communicate with competitors before/after events?** Email lists? Facebook? WhatsApp groups? How do you handle different languages?

## About the Competitors

5. **What's the breakdown by country?** How many from Japan, Korea, Philippines, etc.? Which countries are growing fastest?

6. **How do competitors currently find out about events?** Word of mouth through gyms? Social media? ASJJF listings?

7. **Do competitors travel the full Pro Series?** Or do most just attend their local event + the Open on Guam?

8. **What do competitors complain about most?** Registration? Info access? Travel logistics?

## About Streaming & Video

9. **Have you explored streaming before?** Any previous attempts or conversations with platforms? We saw FloGrappling covered you in 2017-2018 — what happened there?

10. **How many mats are filmed currently?** All mats or just the main mat? What camera setup do you use? (Phone, GoPro, professional cameras?)

11. **Who films the matches?** Dedicated videographer? Volunteers? How many cameras per mat?

12. **The YouTube fight videos** (e.g., "FULL FIGHT Samkang Kim vs Sho Saito") — who uploads those? How do they decide which fights to post?

13. **Who would watch live streams?** Families? Other gyms? BJJ fans? Is there existing demand, or would you need to build it?

14. **Would you want free streaming (grow the audience) or paid (monetize)?** Or freemium — free for prelims, paid for finals?

15. **Have you looked at Smoothcomp?** They have a streaming feature with auto match-cutting and scoreboard overlay. Is that something you've considered?

## About Sponsors

12. **What do sponsors currently get?** Banners at the venue? Logo on the shirt? What's the sponsor package look like?

13. **Would digital sponsor placement (website, streams, results pages) be valuable?** Can you quantify what that ROI looks like vs physical-only?

14. **Who are the biggest sponsors besides GVB?** Local businesses? International brands?

17. **Would other tournament organizers in your network want a similar platform?** Is there a white-label opportunity?

18. **The World Championship offer from Australia — is that still on the table?** What would it take to make that happen?

## About Budget & Engagement

19. **What's the appetite for investing in tech?** Is this something the org would fund, or would it come from GVB money?

20. **What's the decision-making process?** Is it Steve's call, or does it need board/federation approval?

21. **Are there any existing contracts or commitments** with tech vendors, ASJJF, or others that we should know about?

# Questions for Steve — Meeting Prep

## About the Organization

1. **What's the relationship with ASJJF?** Are you contractually required to use their registration platform, or is it by choice? Could you run your own registration alongside or instead of ASJJF?

3. **What's the biggest operational pain point right now?** What takes the most time or causes the most headaches in running these events?

4. **How do you communicate with competitors before/after events?** Email lists? Facebook? WhatsApp groups? How do you handle different languages?

## About the Competitors

5. **What's the breakdown by country?** How many from Japan, Korea, Philippines, etc.? Which countries are growing fastest?

6. **How do competitors currently find out about events?** Word of mouth through gyms? Social media? ASJJF listings?

10. **Who would watch?** Families? Other gyms? BJJ fans? Is there existing demand, or would you need to build it?

## About Budget & Engagement

19. **What's the appetite for investing in tech?** Is this something the org would fund, or would it come from GVB money?
